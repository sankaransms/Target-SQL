--                                               Business Case: Target SQL:

##1) Import the dataset and do usual exploratory analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset:
#1.1) Data type of all columns in the "customers" table:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `businesscase-target-sql.Ecommerce.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE table_name = 'customers'

#1.2)Get the time range between which the orders were placed.
SELECT MIN(order_purchase_timestamp) AS first_date,
       MAX(order_purchase_timestamp) AS final_date

#1.3)Count the Cities & States of "customers who ordered" during the given period.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT geolocation_city) AS No_of_city,
       COUNT(DISTINCT geolocation_state) AS No_of_state
FROM `Ecommerce.geolocation`

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.customer_city) AS No_of_City, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT C.customer_state) AS No_of_State

##4)Impact on Economy: Analyze the money movement by e-commerce by looking at order prices, freight and others.
#4.1) Get the % increase in the cost of orders from year 2017 to 2018 (include months between Jan to Aug only).You can use the "payment_value" column in the payments table to get the cost of orders.

# Top 5 states with highest average delivery time:
SELECT C.customer_state,
       ROUND(AVG(DATETIME_DIFF(O.order_delivered_customer_date,O.order_purchase_timestamp, DAY)),0) AS avg_delivery_day,
FROM `Ecommerce.customers`C
INNER JOIN `Ecommerce.orders`O
ON C.customer_id = O.customer_id
WHERE O.order_delivered_customer_date IS NOT NULL

INNER JOIN `Ecommerce.orders`O
ON C.customer_id = O.customer_id
WHERE O.order_delivered_customer_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY C.customer_state
ORDER BY Avg_fast_delivery DESC
LIMIT 5


##6)Analysis based on the payments:
